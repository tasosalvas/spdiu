# Copy it to spdiu.yaml and modify it to override default settings.

# SpdIU config namespace:
# At least one setting has to be set in it for merging to function correctly.
# Otherwise you're just overriding the defaults with an empty dictionary.

  dirs:
    # Defaults to the tasks.py parent folder.
    # Probably don't mess with it.
    # If you do, make sure it's an aboslute path.
    #base:

    # The script's working directory.
    # Ideally on the same physical drive as the data.
    slots: 'slots'

    # Where to keep downloaded game packages relative to the spdiu folder
    package: packages

  release:
    ## Github API release discovery
    # I'm not a huge fan or anything.
    # I'll be happy to add support other distributors if I had an example.

    # If true, SpdIU uses the github api, ignoring the release_template.
    gh_use_api: true
    # The developer and project names, as they appear on its github url.
    project: Hoto-Mocha/Re-ARranged-Pixel-Dungeon


    ## Download path components
    # These get used as hints to pick the right package,
    # and allow you to template a custom download url if needed.
    # The OS the package is for.
    platform: desktop

    # The file extension of the package.
    # Determines the download name and the installation process.
    extension: jar

    # a tag name can differ from the version on the package,
    # (in fact, the version can differ, too) and you can set it here.
    # i.e. 'download/v3.2.0_based_v3.40.0-FINAL/v3.40.0-desktop.jar'
    #tag_name: null

    # Set this to pin your version to a specific one, ignoring updates.
    # Otherwise SpdIU can figure out the latest.
    #version: null

    # If all else fails, we have the template.
    # A python f-string template to generate the download path.
    #
    # You don't have to use all fields if your url doesn't need them,
    # and you can even use {version_name} as just an extra placeholder.
    #
    # As previously mentioned, this is completely ignored when gh_use_api: true,
    # But here's an example that would work with Re-ARranged:
    template: https://github.com/{project}/releases/download/{tag_name}/{version}-{platform}.{ext}


  ## Game binaries and code
  game:
    # The game data directory.
    # It needs to be an absolute path after user expansion
    data: ~/.local/share/.rearrangedpixel/rearranged-pixel-dungeon

    # The command to run the game, relative to game_dir.
    cmd: java -jar v3.40.0-desktop.jar

    # The java namespace of the game.
    # You can find it on its github, i.e. in build.gradle
    ns: com.rearrangedpixel.rearrangedpixeldungon


  # The name of the default save slot, when you call save with no arguments.
  #default_slot: 'default'

  # The base name of the main backup slot
  #backup_slot: 'bak'
